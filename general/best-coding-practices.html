	<h1>Best coding Practices</h1>
	<p>
		As a coder, developing a coding style that’s mindful of these best practices will make it easier to extend and debug the code in the future. Even if you’re no longer working with that codebase, the legacy of your work will affect the community of developers who work with that code in the future.

Coding best practices help ensure code quality and codebase health. Using good practices when writing code will support the characteristics of good code, that is: Maintainability, scalability, readability, and portability.
